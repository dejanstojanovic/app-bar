# TopBar - tiny extensible top-bar for Windows 

The idea behind this tiny pet project is to have some additional info on one of the secondary screens. I basically just needed my system resources load displayed all the time but did not want to bloat my already overloaded taskbar (any application with this capability will show it only on primary screen taskbar).

That is why I started writing this tiny application. There was bunch of space so I throw in some shortcuts and the rest of the stuff followed

## Features
- Shortcuts to your favorite apps/files/folders (by drag&drop or browse)
- Basic system resources load % (CPU/RAM)
- Switching monitors where the TopBar sits
- Adapting colors to current Windows theme (requires app restart after theme change)

## Known issues
- Windows transparency effect not applied
- Issues displaying the bar on scaled layout monitors
